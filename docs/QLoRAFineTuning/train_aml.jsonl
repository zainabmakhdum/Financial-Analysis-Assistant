The snippets describe an increasingly intensified competitive landscape where Intel has lost market share in recent years and could be harmed if its products fail to meet customer requirements across performance, time-to-market, and roadmap execution [S4]. Intel also faces intense competition across its portfolio from rivals offering CPUs and platform products (e.g., AMD, Qualcomm) and accelerators including GPUs from NVIDIA and other accelerator alternatives, which can pressure share and pricing dynamics [S6]. If Intel's manufacturing yields, operational efficiency, and process roadmap lag competing foundry processes, it may face cost, performance, and time-to-market disadvantages that could weigh on margins and results [S5].\",\"used_snippets\":[\"S4\",\"S6\",\"S5\"]}"}
